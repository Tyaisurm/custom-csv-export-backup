      This add-on's purpose is to help users to have more control over CSV
      exports, while also keeping it simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can customize the properties of export, and start the it via Control
      Panel.

    <p>
      <b
        >N.B., that exports will be placed into your Google Drive, under folder
        named 'Custom CSV Export'.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Reminder about "Reset running status" option in menu:</b> It is used to
      reset "lock" that prevents you from exporting again before previous export
      has been completed. Its main use is to allow exporting again in a
      situation, where the "lock" wasn't removed properly.
    </p>
    <h3>Info about basic format of export file:</h3>
    <p>Each data entry in CSV-file will be separated by ' , ' or ' ; '.</p>
    <p>
      If there are multichoice sections in forms, responses from these will show
      as a SINGLE entry (unless chosen formatting for statistical software in
      settings), having individual answers separated by ' ; ' if you chose ' , '
      as primary separator, and vice versa.
