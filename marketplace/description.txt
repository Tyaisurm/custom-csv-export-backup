# THIS IS AN ADD-ON FOR FORMS #

Custom CSV Export add-on provides a solution to export survey answers straight from Forms into customizable csv-files, so that you can use them more easily with, for example, statistical analysis software.

Since I was unable to find an easy way to export Forms survey responses into csv-files to be used later on, this add-on was born.

This add-on works like this:
- Enable and open add-on in Forms you want to export
- Open add-on's Control Panel
- Edit settings such as "use timestamps" or "use answer indexes (numbers instead of text)" to customize your csv-file's contents
- Press "Export", and your csv-file will be generated and placed into your Drive's root, under "Custom CSV Export" folder
